======================

To build on linux, you need a few packages and their dependencies first.
To install them, under Debian and Ubuntu you can use the following command:


sudo apt-get install build-essential unzip make subversion cmake zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libtool libpcre3-dev mysql-client libmysql++-dev libmysqlclient15-dev

then you need to set executable privileges for our build script:

chmod +x ./build.sh

then you type:

./build.sh

and it'll build everything :)

If it says error or failed at some point, post on our forums (ascnforum.scymex.info) or come to our IRC at:

irc.rizon.net @ #ascnhalf

and ask one of the ops (%, @, &, ~ before their name) or voiced people (+ before their name)


After this all you have to do is to setup your DB and configure the conf files in build/etc.
