======================

To build on linux, you need a few packages and their dependencies first.
To install them, under Debian and Ubuntu you can use the following command:


apt-get install build-essential unzip make subversion cmake zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libtool libpcre3-dev mysql-client libmysql++-dev libmysqlclient15-dev

then change to a directory where you want AscNHalf
for e.g:

cd ~/dev

then type:

wget http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/ascnhalf/trunk/build.sh

after that:

chmod +x ./build.sh

finally:

./build.sh

Answer the questions (press enters when required:P:P) and if it says Build completed, you are ready!
If it says error or failed at some point, post on our forums (ascnforum.scymex.info) or come to our IRC at:

irc.rizon.net @ #ascnhalf

and ask one of the ops (%, @, &, ~ before their name) or voiced people (+ before their name)


After this all you have to do is to setup your DB and configure the conf files in build/etc.
